# Intro

My name is Nguyen Dang Minh, you guys can call me Minh or Dang Minh. I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg), a Singapore-based E-commerce platform in South East Asia. I like learning new things, especially technical skills, building new products that bring great impacts, and working with people. In my free-time, I like sharing my knowledge via [technical blog](https://medium.com/@dmnguyen92), implement newly-learned knowledge in [mini-projects](https://github.com/dmnguyen92), or participate in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/dmdm02). If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# My current projects

At Shopee, I am working on problems related to Recommendation System (Rcmd) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The business prolems that I am leading/making major contribution include, but not limited to:
- Constructing profiles (products, attributes, targeted age/gender, etc.) of listed items
- Building collections of items, including auto-generate cover image and collection's name
- Develop recall and ranking logic/models
- Building general-purpose text-processing library.

Related tasks that I work on a daily basis includes:
- Build and schedule data processing and model training pipeline
- Perform statistical analysis
- Build demo service and deploy models

I also participate in project planning, mentoring junior team members and interviewing candidates.

# My background

- Despite working as a Machine Learning Engineer, my education background is actually **Physics**. I obtained my Bachelor and PhD degree, both in Physics, at [Nanyang Technological University](https://ntu.edu.sg). My research focus was Fluid Mechanics and Numerical Simulation. During my PhD, I implemented Human Learning on myself to acquite Machine Learning knowledge. The original purpose is to process image data collected from my Physics experiments. Afterwards, I participate in some [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dmdm02) competition and grow more interest in this field. As such, I went on to learn it properly on Coursera and Udemy, and decided to start this career after my graduation.
- I was the fist-ever student from NTU to participate in the [Zero-G Parabolic Flight Campaign](https://www.facebook.com/NTUsg/posts/h-eating-out-in-space-without-gravity-and-convection-boiling-liquids-in-space-is/1646596778712827/), organized by the European Space Agency.
- I have participated in several International Physics competition. In 2015, I represented Singapore, joining [International Physics Tournament](https://iptnet.info/) held in Poland, where the team ranked 5th. Before that, in 2010, I won First Prize in Vietnam National Physics Olympiad, then went on to represent Vietnam in [Asia Physics Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Physics_Olympiad), held in Taiwan, where I won Bronze Medal.
