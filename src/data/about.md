# Intro

Hi there, I'm Minh

I am currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer / Team Lead at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg), a Singapore-based E-commerce platform.

My expertised is Machine Learning (ML), Recommendation (Rcmd) System, Natural Language Processing (NLP, Information Retrieval. I also possess strong Analytical, Problem Solving and Leadership Skills.

I like learning new things, working with people to build new products that bring great impacts. I also like sharing my knowledge via [technical blog](https://medium.com/@dmnguyen92), implementing learned stuffs in [mini-projects](https://github.com/dmnguyen92), or participating in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/dmdm02). 

If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
