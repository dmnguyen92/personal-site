I also possess strong Analytical, Problem Solving and Leadership Skills.\n\nI like learning new things, working with people to build new products that bring great impacts. I also like sharing my knowledge via [technical blog](https://medium.com/@dmnguyen92), implementing learned stuffs in [mini-projects](https://github.com/dmnguyen92), or participating in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/dmdm02). \n\nIf you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# My current works\n\nAt Shopee, I am leading a team working on problems related to Rcmd System and NLP, which includes, but not limited to:\n- Develop user-product matching algorithm, capturing different kind of behaviors to give high-quality personalized Rcmd in various business scenarios\n- Design and construct knowledge graph of item and user's profile\n- Build product bundles and automate its naming process using text summarization\n- Build a general-purpose text-processing library.\n\nMy day-to-day:\n- Lead and review technical designs\n- Provide technical leadership and mentorship to team members. Optimizing workflow, exploring latest research to expand the team\u2019s technical boundaries.\n- Build data processing and model training pipeline\n- Submerge in data, find values in data\n\n# My background\n\n- Both my Bachelor and PhD degree are in **Physics**, obtained from [Nanyang Technological University](https://ntu.edu.sg). My research focus was Fluid Mechanics and Numerical Simulation. \n- I started learning ML to serve my PhD research, then start falling in love with it\n- I was honored to be a participant of the [Zero-G Parabolic Flight Campaign](https://www.facebook.com/NTUsg/posts/h-eating-out-in-space-without-gravity-and-convection-boiling-liquids-in-space-is/1646596778712827/), organized by the European Space Agency.\n- I have participated in several International Physics competition. In 2015, I represented Singapore, joining [International Physics Tournament](https://iptnet.info/) held in Poland, where the team ranked 5th. Before that, in 2010, I won First Prize in Vietnam National Physics Olympiad, then went on to represent Vietnam in [Asia Physics Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Physics_Olympiad), held in Taiwan, where I won Bronze Medal.\n\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(s.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Nguyen Dang Minh",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(s.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(o.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
